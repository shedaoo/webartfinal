    <p>Born and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas, nervy began learning to whittle knives out of sticks at the ripe age of 3. Her early life was difficult, as her mother was an active cannibal and her older brother had dropped out of art school to pursue his dream of becoming a local cryptid. nervy then turned to hardcore drugs and gambling on turtle races. She got <b>fucked up.</b> Once her mother had saved up enough money from stealing money from the people she ate, nervy was finally able to go to college and learn to code despite not even knowing what a phone is. She still sucks at coding, but she made this game.</p>
